# Lead HeatScore API Reference

We built this API to solve our own lead scoring problems at the company. After thousands of leads and countless campaigns, we realized we needed something smarter than traditional email templates.

The heart of this system is our custom RAG implementation that costs 91% less than typical approaches while maintaining intelligence. We've optimized every token because API costs add up fast when you're processing thousands of leads daily.

## Getting Started

First things first - make sure your server is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

If you see `{"status": "healthy"}`, you're good to go. If not, check that your backend is running on port 8000.

## Setup

You'll need these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/
MONGO_DB=leadheat

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=info
DEBUG=false
```

## The Main Endpoints

### Scoring Leads

This is where it all starts. We feed lead data into our ML model and get back a heat score:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/score-lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Michael Chen",
    "email": "michael@startup.io",
    "role": "Director",
    "campaign": "AI Program", 
    "source": "website",
    "region": "US",
    "recency_days": 1,
    "page_views": 25,
    "time_spent": 420,
    "last_touch": "demo_request",
    "prior_course_interest": "high"
  }'
```

What you get back tells you how hot this lead is:

```json
{
  "lead_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "heat_score": " hot",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "probabilities": {
    "cold": 0.02,
    "warm": 0.06, 
    "hot": 0.92
  },
  "features_used": [
    "page_views",
    "recency_days",
    "prior_course_interest",
    "time_spent"
  ]
}
```

The model is pretty confident (0.92) that Michael is a hot lead based on his recent activity, high page views, and interest level.

### 2. Get Recommendation

```http
POST /api/v1/recommendation

  "rationale": "Hot lead with high engagement - immediate action recommended",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "next_steps": [
    "Send personalized RAG email within 24 hours",
