### **Section 2: Live Demo - Hot Lead (1:30 - 3:00)**
*Screen: Frontend interface*

**"Now let's see this in action. I'll demonstrate with three different lead profiles, starting with a hot lead."**

*Upload test CSV or manually input lead data*

**Lead Profile: Sarah Johnson**
- Director at TechCorp
- 1 day recency
- 25 page views
- Demo request
- High prior interest

*Submit and show results*

**"The system classified Sarah as HOT with 87% confidence. Notice the probability breakdown:**
- **Hot: 87%**
- **Warm: 8%** 
- **Cold: 5%**

**Feature importance shows page views and recency as top predictors - exactly what we'd expect for a hot lead."**

*Click on "Get Recommendation"*

**"The RAG system generates a personalized recommendation: 'Schedule immediate demo call within 24 hours' with specific messaging tailored to her director role and high engagement."**
